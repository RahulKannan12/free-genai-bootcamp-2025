# Implementation 1

- I am going to try implementing with my zone of programming languages, comfortable with c# as backend and Angular in frontend
- even though I know how things work in c# web api, I am going to completely reliant on AI coding assistant
- using Github Co-pilot subscription version
- using the tech specs from Andrew brown
- backend database - sqlite


## Technical uncertainties

- Backend implementation was so ease with my comfortable language (c#), I used the same method you and Ryan, step by step instructions and ticking off the respective tasks once done
- there are few implications in choosing the right package version on external dependencies, needs manual intervention
