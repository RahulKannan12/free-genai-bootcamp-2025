## Observations

### Technical Uncertainty & Hypothesis

- The model couldn't perform well consistently, answers are getting very random - Hallucinations is very frequent
- Tried with 2B & 8B model, both in local environment, since there is a limitation of only 25 prompts in online hosted playground by IBM.
- Both the size models are inconsistent and not suitable to proceed for our requirement

### Final Outcome

- Can be used for simple use cases like summarization, suggestions since it is open-source (free), but not suitable for our requirement
