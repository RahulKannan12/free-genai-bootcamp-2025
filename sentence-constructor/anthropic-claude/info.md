## Observations

### Technical Uncertainty & Hypothesis

- Model cannot be hosted locally, dependant on hosted environment from Anthropic
- Claude Haiku - lightweight solution compared to Claude Sonnet, equivalently performing well
- Performed really well, with basic prompting, on improving the prompts using the techniques specifically available for claude, it would be the best in class
- ($$$) expensive solution

### Final Outcome

- Very Highly recommended, best out of the rest.
