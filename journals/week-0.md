### Week - 0 Journaling

My Thought process on approaching this week

- It is all about prompting - Natural language - I intend to search all the information about prompting techniques / guides and try applying that
- Architecting a basic AI assistance guide and integrating with an existing application

Setting up my local to run the different models

Ollama + Open webui + desired models - documented the steps in 

Learned a lot about prompting techniques and methodologies

Initial thought was analysing the open-source solutions available, since meta ai, mistral is already evaluated by Andrew, I thought of exploring any other 3 open source LLMs available.

- Google's gemma 
- IBM's granite
- Microsoft's orca

The local setup of llama helped me to evaluate the models, all three aren't suitable for our requirement (sentence-constructor), but in the process of analyzing I found Google Responsible Generative AI toolkit, which has open source tools like Learning Interpretability Tool, LLM Comparator

Closed source - Paid solutions 

- Anthropic Claude
- OpenAI Gpt4

Claude is extremely good, I didn't even improvised the prompts specific to claude, it really gave a good result, I am impressed.
